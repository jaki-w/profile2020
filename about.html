  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I am a programming student learning JavaScript, C#, and React. While these are the languages and libraries that I am learning first, I plan on learning even more. I am currently scoping out Ruby and Python, as well! </p>
  <p>In 2017 I transplanted from Arizona to Portland, Oregon and became a manager at Barnes and Noble. Between stacks of books and a cozy cafe, I learned how to effectively lead a team, create and meet goals, and manage resources with efficiency. More importantly, I learned that I was ready to do more.</p>
  <p>As someone who enjoys being creative and has always had an interest in tech, a future in programming suits me quite well. I am excited to learn and create! I can't wait to build programs and applications that inspire and connect humans. </p>
